# SQL Scripts for Data Engineering and ETL Processes

## Overview

This repository contains SQL scripts aimed at facilitating data engineering tasks and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes. Each script addresses a specific aspect of data manipulation and transformation.

## Scripts Description

1. **create_staging_tables.sql** - Creates staging tables to temporarily hold raw data during ETL processes.
2. **load_data_into_staging.sql** - Loads raw data into staging tables from external sources.
3. **transform_customer_data.sql** - Cleanses and transforms customer data for integration into the main database.
4. **aggregate_sales_data.sql** - Aggregates sales data to prepare for reporting and analysis.
5. **update_dimension_tables.sql** - Updates dimension tables with new or modified data.
6. **calculate_kpis.sql** - Computes key performance indicators (KPIs) for business analysis.
7. **data_quality_checks.sql** - Performs data quality checks to ensure data integrity and accuracy.
8. **archive_old_data.sql** - Archives outdated data to maintain database performance.
9. **create_indexes.sql** - Creates indexes on key tables to optimize query performance.
10. **drop_temp_tables.sql** - Removes temporary tables that are no longer needed after ETL processes.

## Usage

To utilize these scripts in your database environment:

1. **Review and Modify:** Adjust table names, column names, or data sources to match your database schema and requirements.
2. **Execute Scripts:** Run each SQL script in the appropriate sequence to perform the ETL processes.
3. **Verify Changes:** After execution, verify that the intended transformations and data movements have been applied correctly.
